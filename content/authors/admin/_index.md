I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at The Nature Conservancy North Carolina and The Center for Biodiversity Outcomes at Arizona State University's Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability. Under the NatureNet Science Fellowship program, I am investigating nutrient pollution risk associated with intensified agriculture, such as concentrated animal feeding operations, under increased flooding and hurricanes.
